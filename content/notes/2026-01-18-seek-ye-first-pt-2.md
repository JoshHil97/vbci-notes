We established from looking at the gospel, that the kingdom was Gods priority so the Kingdom was Jesus’s priority. 

Go and do kingdom work. One of Jesus key values was the kingdom. Every believer must have values - spiritual values, social values, financial values. If  don’t have values as an individual, go and establish values for yourself. If you have values it becomes a boundary for yourself therefore there are certain things you won’t entertain.

Jesus Christ knew that his value system was around the kingdom therefore all he did and enabled himself to do was around the kingdom.

We established in Genesis 1:1, that in the beginning God.

Genesis 1:1 (NKJV) 

If you don’t give something to God, anything can lay claim to it. Your life belongs to God therefore nothing has a legal right to come and take you away from God. 

The more you are giving, the more God will give on to you. At the beginning of everything there should be a giving mentality and sowing mentality. Be a giver. Stop being mr and Mrs Armstrong and be a giver! Stinginess will not work in the kingdom.

As you prepare to give somebody, God is preparing someone to give to you. Give! Give something, prepare and package. Give to people. Every time wish list, no more wish list have a give list.

Mathew 6:24-33 (MSG) 

Last week we established that seeking is: 1. Pursuing  2. Studying 3. Exploring 

Mathew 6:33 (MSG) 

What you do first in life really really matters. Sometimes people get carried away because they have substance. 

You have 500k or a million, you’ll realise the money is small when you meet a billionaire. You realise that when you meet someone with more than you, you realise what you have is 50p.

Has anyone ever hovered coins? It’s because you have! There was once a time where you valued pennies. 

The way we behave is because we think all we have is our own doing until you meet someone who has  more than you and more capacity than you, then you realise that the thing you have is actually very insignificant.

First fruit is not compulsory.  Many people give to God without loving him first. Many people think they can help God but you can’t help God with your money. It’s a blessing for you. 

It’s the same way bathing is not compulsory but it is helpful. There are many things in life that aren’t compulsory but helpful. First fruit is not compulsory but for those who do, it is helpful. 

Many people are very uptight when it comes to money. You’re uptight and bravado about your money because God doesn’t have you as an individual. God wants you before your cash, God wants you before your service . God wants all of you. 

For example take a footballer, a footballer is seeking first his sport - he’s seeking football , so if you tell him to do 5k or 10k and not eating a certain food, it’s not a problem to him. Why? Because it’s part of him seeking first that sport. 

For us as believers, when we are seeking God and they tell us to fast and pray it’s not a problem because we are seeking first the kingdom of God. 

You can’t fast and pray to give to God when you haven’t sought his kingdom first.  Many people are sitting in the church who are not believers. Believers mean they have faith in something.  You can be attending but do you believe in the thing you say you believe. 

Mathew 6:33 (AMPC)

Seeking is also understanding.

Our understanding of Jesus and his things must develop, must grow and become deepened.

When you’re seeking first the kingdom it means that you’re aiming, you’re striving and you’re chasing after the kingdom. You’re chasing after this thing. 

When it comes to the things of God and especially your giving, don’t give because you’ve seen another person give. Give because you have conviction. Just like Abraham, you may become a murderer because Abraham was having a one on one conversation with God.

It’s like following someone in a car but you don’t know where they are going. So as  you are preparing for the first fruit, give what you are convicted to give.


To seek after the kingdom is to desire, to love after the kingdom and chase after it. 

Many of us prayer loudly here but our voice is silent in heaven whereas someone pray really quietly but their voice is loud in heaven because what we see in front of us is not the same thing God interprets in heaven. 

God can see our hearts. We are not moved by what people can do in front of us. You cannot bluff God with your money. You don’t have enough to help the kingdom of God.  Seek ye first the kingdom of God! Seek God first. 

Before anything you have, God wants you. He wants your very being.  Many people are going to be disappointed before they stand before God and feel cheated. 

Yes you came to church, every Sunday week after week but you didn’t give your whole being to God! Give your whole being to him! The church has become so weak that because of money and tithe, we sit people at the front of church. 

We are not seeking God as a verse but as a whole lifestyle.

To be seeking God is to be preoccupied with the Kingdom

It means it must be your obsession. We are obsessed with Gods kingdom first. 

No money you earn will ever impress God.  Even if you are a millionaire, God will not be impressed or be moved. Be humble and reduce yourself, you’re too big. 

Humble yourself, if you don’t humble yourself Christianity will not last another generation. Freely, you haven’t paid anything. 

Too many of us are too shy. You seek first the kingdom of God at church but when you leave the walls of the church, you can’t seek him first. You are occupied with other things.

Because of wedding, you’ve lost sight of the kingdom. In seasons of your life, you’ve lost sight can lose sight of the gospel and you don’t know when Christ will come! Will he come and see you focussed on the kingdom or focussed on the other things?

To be seeking the kingdom is to be preoccupied with the kingdom. Wherever you go or have the opportunity, you should minister.

If you’ve given your life, what’s your pocket? You’ll never give to God and see yourself scratching your head. Let’s  graduate these things there’s bigger things to be done! More things to be done. 


To be seeking for the Kingdom is to be hungry for the Kingdon. 

There must be a hunger and something beating and panting inside of you. You shouldn’t be experiencing hunger past day 14, you should be feeling joy. You must begin to push beyond the 6-6, don’t break. Flow and enjoy the glory.

To seek the Kingdom is to be hungry for the kingdom! People queue for night clubs, until our people are stood outside the rain waiting to come to church we haven’t reached revival! 

Some people only come early because they don’t wanna sit in overflow, they wanna sit in the auditorium. They don’t want to pray! This is not revival,  there must be hunger. There must be something inside of you.

Be hungry for the kingdom of God. You must desire to see the kingdom of God wherever you make yourself manifest.
 
Seeking the Kingdom of God is an act of love

John 3:16 (NIV)

God so loved the world that he gave. He didn’t give because he loved, he loved first and then he gave. 

The highest thing that anybody wants in a relationship is love.  That’s why you see wealthy people still desiring love. Above everything you can give God, he wants your being, your relationship and your time.

When you come at the beginning of the year, you are giving God your best.  It’s a microscopic expression of everything about us. That we love him irrespective of where we may find ourselves. 

For something to be FIRST:

It’s to put that thing above every other things.

There are many things you can do but if you don’t do it first it loses significance. God says put me first, put my kingdom first. My domain first and my kingdom first. 

When God is first, you begin to budget and prepare because God is above every other thing. 


When something is first, it’s your primary interest

That many things are interesting but this is of the primary interest to you. 

When something is first, it’s my priority.  

Many people struggle with priorities in life, many people don’t know where their priorities lie. There was a time where people used to miss church for concerts because they lack priorities.

Some people can’t even keep to a priority for 12 months. To be consistent means to say this thing is my aim and I’m going to finish this thing.

Can you hold first the thing that says it’s your priority the whole year. Some of you say you’re going to start this thing and start this diet but 18 days into the year and you’ve already failed.

When we seek ye first the kingdom, we are talking about the priority, 

Luke 5:1-7  (NKJV)

The reality was Simon was working according to natural laws but Jesus Christ said I am going to show you supernatural laws, that when you put me first I can break every protocol.

In this season, may our nets begin to break and may experience net breaking on every side. 
Whatever the devil tells you is not possible is actually possible. 

The devil is a liar and the father of lies. Him and all his subordinates, they are all liars. Whenever you hear a voice tell you, you  can’t do something that’s the very thing you can do.

Mathew 6;33 (MSG)

The kingdom is his domain, where he exists, it’s his sphere of influence. It’s him himself. When we seek the Kingdom, we are looking for God himself.

The devil knows the power of the kingdom and doesn’t want you to go for the power of the kingdom, so this year desire to chase after the kingdom with everything you have. 

Matthew 13:44-46 (NIV)

The kingdom of God is precious. What are we willing to give away in order to have the kingdom? 

Before you bring your seed, be at the right standing with God. Righteous and holiness are things that have departed from the church.  Someone may be gifted so even though they live an unholy life, we let them do what they want because they are gifted, that cannot be right.

It’s not just seeking first the kingdom but it seeking first righteousness. God has a standard. God has standards. 

In a manufacturing centre, when they make trainers and it doesn’t meet a certain standard, they discard it so if they have standards why can’t God?

God has a standard and he wants us to meet those standards. Gods standards are not unrealistic.

When you are talking about righteous, you are talking about standards. So seek first his standards.

Philippians 3:8 (NIV)/ (AMPC) 

Paul was willing to let go of everything to follow Jesus.  Paul is saying knowing Jesus is a privilege. When you compare your life before and after knowing Christ, there must be a difference.

After knowing Jesus, things have to change. You are either seeking him first or you’re not. You’re ever changed or you’re not. When you begin to hunger for certain  things, you lose taste for others. But people still have dual-taste.

In our year of total salvation, you must be saved and saved well. Not just a period of salvation. 

Paul says “I count it a privilege.” It is an advantage to know Jesus. For anybody young anything for the kingdom, may God replenish you. May you come out better and stronger.

As we approach first fruit, aside from your substance, if you don’t have faith for it - keep it to yourself.  If you’re not sure, open scriptures and ask for revelation. If you don’t get it, keep quiet.

Discouraging others from doing it means you are at war with him. Those who have faith let them do it and be blessed. Don’t ask people what do you think, what do you think is destroying God during this time.

Before we come with our substance, we are coming with our whole hearts. We must experience total salvation. 

Mathew 6:34 (MSG) 

Give your entire attention, not some of but your entire attention to what God is doing right now. God is doing something great for us, don’t be scared of what’s in your hand. Let it go and as you let it go, God has a way of replenishing and refilling what has been released.

Prayer: God, let your kingdom come. Let people seek you first and look for you first above every and any other thing. Lord we know that as we look to you first, you’ll call any and every other thing to be added onto us. 

Let your kingdom be seen, let your kingdom be experienced.
